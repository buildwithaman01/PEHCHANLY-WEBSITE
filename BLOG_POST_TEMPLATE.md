## 1. Check Their Portfolio (Real Projects Matter)

### Why It's Important:
A portfolio shows **actual results**, not just promises. Look for:
- Live websites they've built (not just mockups)
- Variety of industries served
- Mobile responsiveness
- Loading speed

### What to Look For:
✅ **Live links** to real client websites  
✅ **Case studies** with measurable results  
✅ **Before/after** comparisons  
✅ **Similar projects** to what you need  

### Red Flags:
❌ Only showing templates or stock designs  
❌ No live links (just screenshots)  
❌ Portfolio looks outdated  
❌ Can't provide client references  

**Pro Tip:** Visit their portfolio sites on your phone. If they're slow or broken on mobile, that's a major red flag!

---

## 2. Read Client Testimonials & Reviews

### Where to Check:
- **Google My Business** reviews
- **LinkedIn** recommendations
- **Clutch.co** ratings
- **Their website** testimonials

### What Good Reviews Look Like:
> "Pehchanly delivered our e-commerce site in 3 weeks. Sales increased by 200% in the first month!" - *Rajesh Kumar, Mumbai*

### Red Flags:
❌ All 5-star reviews (too perfect = fake)  
❌ Generic testimonials ("Great work!")  
❌ No reviews at all  
❌ Negative reviews about missed deadlines  

---

## 3. Evaluate Their Technical Expertise

### Essential Technologies (2025):
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Vue.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, PHP
- **Database**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Hosting**: AWS, Vercel, Netlify
- **SEO**: Schema markup, Core Web Vitals

### Questions to Ask:
1. "What tech stack do you recommend for my project?"
2. "How do you ensure website speed?"
3. "Do you follow SEO best practices?"
4. "Will my site be mobile-responsive?"
5. "How do you handle security?"

**Pro Tip:** If they can't explain technical concepts in simple terms, they might not understand them well!

---

## 4. Understand Their Process

### A Good Agency Should Have:
1. **Discovery Phase** - Understanding your business
2. **Planning** - Wireframes, mockups, timeline
3. **Development** - Regular updates, demos
4. **Testing** - QA, bug fixes, performance checks
5. **Launch** - Deployment, training
6. **Support** - Post-launch maintenance

### Red Flags:
❌ "We'll start coding tomorrow!" (no planning)  
❌ No clear timeline  
❌ No testing phase  
❌ No post-launch support  

---

## 5. Check Communication & Responsiveness

### Test Them:
- How fast do they respond to your inquiry?
- Do they ask good questions about your business?
- Are they available on WhatsApp/phone/email?
- Do they explain things clearly?

**Pro Tip:** If they're slow to respond during sales, imagine how slow they'll be during the project!

---

## 6. Compare Pricing (But Don't Choose Cheapest!)

### Typical Pricing in India (2025):

| Package | Price Range | What You Get |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Basic** | ₹25,000 - ₹50,000 | 5-page website, basic design, 2 weeks |
| **Standard** | ₹75,000 - ₹1,50,000 | 10-page site, custom design, SEO, 4 weeks |
| **Premium** | ₹2,00,000+ | Custom web app, advanced features, 8+ weeks |

### Remember:
- **Cheapest ≠ Best value**
- **Most expensive ≠ Best quality**
- Look for **transparent pricing**
- Ask about **hidden costs**

---

## 7. Verify Their Location & Availability

### Why Location Matters:
- **Time zone** alignment for calls
- **Local understanding** of your market
- **In-person meetings** if needed
- **Legal jurisdiction** for contracts

### Major Tech Hubs in India:
- **Bangalore** - Largest tech hub
- **Mumbai** - Finance & startups
- **Delhi NCR** - Corporate & government
- **Pune** - IT services
- **Hyderabad** - Software development
- **Kolkata** - Emerging tech scene

**Pro Tip:** Remote agencies can work great, but ensure they're available during your business hours!

---

## 8. Ask About Post-Launch Support

### Essential Support Services:
- **Bug fixes** (first 30-90 days free?)
- **Content updates** (how much per month?)
- **Security updates** (included?)
- **Hosting management** (who handles it?)
- **Backup & recovery** (automated?)

### Questions to Ask:
1. "What's included in post-launch support?"
2. "How quickly do you respond to issues?"
3. "What are your monthly maintenance costs?"
4. "Do you offer SLA (Service Level Agreement)?"

---

## 9. Review Their Contract & Terms

### Must-Have Clauses:
✅ **Scope of work** (detailed)  
✅ **Timeline** with milestones  
✅ **Payment schedule** (never 100% upfront!)  
✅ **Ownership rights** (you own the code)  
✅ **Refund policy** (if they don't deliver)  
✅ **Confidentiality** (NDA)  

### Red Flags:
❌ Vague scope of work  
❌ Demanding full payment upfront  
❌ No refund policy  
❌ They own your website code  

---

## 10. Trust Your Gut

### Good Signs:
✅ They ask lots of questions about your business  
✅ They suggest improvements to your ideas  
✅ They're honest about timelines  
✅ They show genuine interest in your success  
✅ You feel comfortable communicating with them  

### Bad Signs:
❌ They promise unrealistic results

❌ Something just feels "off"
